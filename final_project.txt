In this analysis, I worked with the Iris dataset to explore how flower measurements differ between three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. I started by looking at the shape and spread of the data using visual tools like histograms and boxplots. For example, the histogram of Sepal Length showed that most flowers had lengths clustered around the middle, with a few longer ones. When I broke that down by species in a boxplot, it became clear that each species has its own size patternâ€”Setosa tends to have the shortest sepals, while Virginica has the longest. A scatterplot comparing Sepal Length and Petal Length also showed a strong upward trend, hinting that these two traits are closely related.

To dig deeper, I ran a few statistical tests. A t-test comparing Sepal Length between Setosa and Versicolor showed a clear difference, which means these species have distinct sepal sizes. I also ran an ANOVA to see if Sepal Length differs among all three species, and the results confirmed it does. I checked the correlation between Sepal and Petal Length and found a strong, positive linkâ€”basically, when one increases, so does the other. A simple linear regression backed this up, showing that Petal Length is a good predictor of Sepal Length. Altogether, the analysis shows that flower measurements vary significantly by species and are strongly connected to one another, which could be useful for identifying or classifying different types of irises.
